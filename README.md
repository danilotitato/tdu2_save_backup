# TDU2 save backup

Well, this game have the annoyance of corrupting save files too easily
I hadn't planned to upload it anywhere but... why not? May help the community before TDU SC is released

It will keep the last 10 backups to prevent the deletion of a good save backup

You can add it to a batch file to run every time you initialize the game (see sample.bat file) or run it manually on any Windows CLI:
`python tdu2_save_backup.py`

You should install Python for Windows before running this if it is not installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/

PS: I wouldn't advise you to schedule it as a job. It can backup corrupted saves while you are not playing
